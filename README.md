# My Tennis Club ðŸŽ¾

My Tennis Club is a web application used to represent some data
about the members of a tennis club. This is
my first-ever Django project and it was intended for learning
purposes only.

## Configuration

#### Middleware

* [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Pip package
that allows web apps to serve their static files such as JavaScript, CSS,
and Images.

#### Database 

* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html): Embedded, serverless
relational database management system.
